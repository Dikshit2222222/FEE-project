              <p>Newton observed that the spectrum of colours exiting a prism in the position of minimum deviation is oblong, the prism refracts different colours by different angles.</p>

              <p>The dispute then broke out in full force in 1711 when the Royal Society labelled Leibniz a fraud. It was later found that Newton wrote the study's concluding remarks on Leibniz.</p>

                  <p id="tribute-info"><b>Sir Isaac Newton (25 December 1642 – 20 March 1727) was an English mathematician, physicist, astronomer, alchemist, theologian, and author who was described in his time as a natural philosopher. He was a key figure in the Scientific Revolution and the Enlightenment that followed. His pioneering book Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica (Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy), first published in 1687, consolidated many of his and others previous results and established classical mechanics. Newton also made seminal contributions to optics, and shares credit with German mathematician Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz for developing infinitesimal calculus.</b></p>
